# Connect4
A Connect4 game.
Two players play the game. 
We first decide the order of playing.
Then, alternatively, each player fills a circle in the column of his choice from a given board of 7 columns.
Circles are added on top of the other if the bottom circle is filled. The board contains 6 rows. 
The game ends if there are 4 continuous circles for one player or the entire board is filled up. They can be diagonal, vertical or horizontal.
